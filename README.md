# FreeCodeCampe
Free Code Camp is a free online resource for learning how to code.
This folder is a sample of some of the code I've been learning to make through the JavaScript Algorithims and Data Structures certification course.

Much of the code here isn't optimized, or is a method of doing a particular function the long way.

This is to showcase what I've been learning and working on.

I'm always looking to improve my skills, so feel free to look through this and offer me any tips and tricks you like!
